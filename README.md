# House_Price_Prediction_project
This repository contains a Python implementation of a house price prediction model using linear regression. Linear regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for predicting numerical values, making it suitable for predicting house prices based on various features.

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

Python (>= 3.6)
NumPy (>= 1.18.0)
Pandas (>= 1.0.0)
Scikit-learn (>= 0.23.0)
Matplotlib (>= 3.2.0) (optional, only required for visualization)

							
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model should be in CSV format. Each row in the CSV file represents a house listing with multiple features and the corresponding house price.

The dataset should have the following columns:

sqft_living:The area of the house living in or the build up area (in square feet or square meters).
sqft_lot:The total area of the plot (in square feet or square meters).
bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house.
Basement: The area of basement space available.
age: The age of the house (in years).
price: The price of the house (target variable).
condition	:The quality of the house in the current date.
floors:The no. of floors present in the house.
waterfront:The house is next to an water body or not.
Make sure to preprocess the data if required (e.g., handling missing values, scaling features) before training the model.

Acknowledgments
This implementation is for educational purposes and is inspired by various machine learning courses and tutorials. Special thanks to the authors of the libraries used in this project.
Note: This project assumes that the dataset and features are appropriate for a linear regression model. In practice, more advanced techniques, feature engineering, or different algorithms may be necessary to improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, this model may not be suitable for highly complex or non-linear datasets.
